# React + Vite
Sure, I can help you create a README documentation for your app based on the provided code snippets. Here's a draft:

## App Project: A Simple Transaction Tracker

### Overview

This app is a simple transaction tracker that allows users to add, view, and manage their personal expenses and income. It features a user-friendly interface, real-time calculations, and data persistence using sessionStorage.

### Features

- Add new transactions with item, amount, and description
- View a list of all transactions
- Calculate total income and expense
- Delete transactions
- Persist transaction data using sessionStorage

### Usage
1. Open the app in your web browser.
2. If you are a new visitor, you will be prompted to sign up with your email account before you can access the platform.
3. Once you have signed up, you can start using the app to add, view, and manage your transactions.
4. Enter the item, amount, and description for the transaction you want to add.
5. Click the "Add Transaction" button to add the transaction to the list.
6. View the total income and expense at the top of the page.
7. To delete a transaction, click the "x" button next to the transaction item.
8. The app will automatically save your transaction data in sessionStorage, so your transactions will persist even after you refresh the page or close the browser window.



### Code Structure

The app consists of three main components:

1. **AllTransactions:** This component handles the main UI and logic of the app, including displaying the transaction list, adding new transactions, calculating income and expense, and deleting transactions.
2. **TotalBalance:** This component displays the total balance, which is calculated as total income minus total expense.
3. **IncomeExpense:** This component displays the total income and expense separately.

### Technologies Used

- React (JavaScript library for building user interfaces)
- Tailwind CSS (CSS framework for rapid UI development)

### Installation

To install the app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn.
3. Run the development server using npm start or yarn start.

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
